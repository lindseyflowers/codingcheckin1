<h1> <em> The Garden of Forking Paths</em>  </h1>
<h2> An Interpretation </h2>

<p> The "garden of forking paths" has come to represent hypertext and the world wide web. </p>

<p> The world wide web has endless directions that one can create, and those directions can be created in any order. When creating this website, I started with the summary and then went back and did the homepage. I then did the interpretation page, and then adjusted a few details on the first two pages. While the homepage is meant to be viewed first, I did not make it first. I created my own small labyrinth of webpages simply by using hypertext to tell the computer what to configure. Linear direction has no meaning when interacting with the world wide web. </p>

<p> The way users interact with the world wide web is also a labyrinth of intertwining possibilities. Users do not have to follow linear steps to get to a web page, they can create their own path. To get to a single specific web page, users have a multitude of options: They can google the page, they can go to the homepage and then click through a site to get to a specific page, they can access the page through their bookmarks, or even have a friend email them the link. Users do not have to interact with the world wide web in a linear fashion, creating a web of infinite possibilities. </p>
