  <h1> A Summary <h1>

    <p>  Doctor Yu Tsun is a German spy living in the UK during World War 1. He has found where the British are keeping their artillery, but cannot relay the message because Captain Richard Madden is out to arrest him. He seeks refuge with Doctor Stephen Albert, a sinologist.  Doctor Albert has been studying the works of Tsun's ancestor,Ts'ui P&ecirc;n Ts'ui P&ecirc;n died while working on an unfinished book and creating a labyrinth. For centuries, readers and sinologists have been trying to interpret jumbled book and discover where the labyrtinth is hidden. </p>

    <p> Doctor Albert reveals that he has interpreted Ts'ui P&ecirc;n's work: The book is the labyrinth. The book describes a world where when one makes a decision, he does not eliminate all other decisions like one does in the normal world. These diverging and multiplying paths create a "garden of forking paths", where multiple timelines can exist at once. </p>

    <p> Yu Tsun's plan to thank Doctor Albert is foiled when he sees Doctor Madden walking up the path to Doctor Albert's house. In a stroke of brilliance, he takes out his gun and shoots and kills Doctor Albert. </p>

    <p> Madden arrests Yu Tsun and sentences him to death by hanging. Despite this, Yu Tsun managed to pass the location of the British Artillery onto his German comrades: The machinery was hidden in Albert Park. When his allies saw the headlines of Yu Tsun murdering Doctor Albert, they knew just where to go. </p>
