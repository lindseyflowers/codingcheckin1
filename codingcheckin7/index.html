<h3> The Origin Story: Sunshine </h3>
<p> I've always had a thing for giraffes. It started when I was little,  with a giraffe named sunshine. Sunshine was a 12-inch tall giraffee with a stiff neck that had a penchant for tearing at the seams. I don't know when I got him, just that I always had him. My mom and I used to start every morning with the "Sunshine Song," an instant hit based off of the hit "Starshine" by Hair. </p>

<p> We changed the lyrics to "Good Morning Sunshine/The Earth Says Hello/You're so tallllll/you can't even see your toes," in order to make it an ode to my stuffed best friend. </p>
