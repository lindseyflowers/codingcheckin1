<h3> Humble Beginnings </h3>

<p> I've always had a thing for giraffes. It started when I was little,  with a giraffe named sunshine. Sunshine was a 12-inch tall giraffee with a stiff neck that had a penchant for tearing at the seams. I don't know when I got him, just that I always had him. My mom and I used to start every morning with the "Sunshine Song," an instant hit based off of the hit "Starshine" by Hair. </p>

<p> We changed the lyrics to "Good Morning Sunshine/The Earth Says Hello/You're so tallllll/you can't even see your toes," in order to make it an ode to my stuffed best friend. </p>

<h4>Travis</h4>
<p>It all began with a trip to Kroger. It was the pre-Valentine's Day season, and my heart was taken by a thirty-dollar stuffed giraffe with a heart shaped nose next to the produce isle. I wasn't able to forget about him, and I told my mom about my broken heart on the phone the next night. She laughed at me, mocking my lameness and lack of significant other to buy it for me. </p>

<p> A week later,  I got home from campus at 2 a.m., stressed, tired, and ready for bed. There was a Baby's-R-Us box waiting outside our front door with my name on it. Confused, I brought it inside; last time I checked I wasn't expecting a baby nor a package from one. I used a knife from the dirty side of the sink to open it, too tired to scower around for my scissors. Inside was the ugliest giraffe I had ever seen. His neck was too droopy to support his weight, half the hair surrounding his eye was falling out, and his hooves resembled crab claws. </p>

<p> He was perfect. </p>

<p> My mom called me the next morning, casually (kind of yelling) asking if I got a package. She screamed when I told her he came. She had ordered him immediately after we got off the phone last week, but the snow storm prevented him from getting to me by Valentine's Day. </p>

<p> I was three when I got my first giraffe and twenty when I got my latest one. Shoutout to Travis for being the best, most hideous Valentine a girl could ask for </p>
